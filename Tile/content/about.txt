"We said 'Tile' because the whole gamemode was going to be like a 'puzzle', you said that if we made something, it would be a good addition; we should add it. A custom admin mod? Add it: Custom prop protection? Add it: Custom chat box? Add it: and all the parts of the mod will be like tiles that fit together." ~Seke

"Tile is basically a canvas for Seke and I. It's like our lua coding portfolio in public display for everyone to see" ~Beenston

"You know... when Kramkoob said I was ignorant, I brushed it off; then last night while I was sleeping I realized how much I did for the gamemode... I'm going to punch a hole in his neck." ~Seke
